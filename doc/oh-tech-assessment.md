# Technical Assessment

## Objective

Build a simple, working tic-tac-toe application using AI tools (such as
OpenHands, GPT, or Copilot) to assist you during development. The goal is not to
create a perfect app but to demonstrate how you approach building under time
constraints using modern tools and how you communicate your process.

## Requirements

- Build a playable tic-tac-toe game. It can be in any language or framework you
  choose.
- Use at least one AI tool to assist with the development process
- Record your screen while you work.

Beyond that, you are free to choose how to implement it! You could:

- Build a simple frontend-only game in React or another framework
- Create a CLI version that runs in the terminal
- Build a backend API that models game logic and state
- Wrap the game in a containerized deployment with infrastructure automation
- Use AI to help drive gameplay logic, generate explanations, or scaffold your
  architecture

Show us what you do best! We're not looking for one specific outcome — we're
interested in seeing how you choose to interpret the task, how you apply tools
to solve problems, and how you scope and execute a project under limited time.

Your submission should be something that runs (or could run with minor effort)
and shows your ability to deliver a coherent, working slice of functionality.

## Time Limit

Spend no more than 3 hours total, including setup. Done is better than perfect;
we care more about your reasoning, prioritization, and problem-solving than
polish.

## What We're Looking For

- How you break down and approach the problem
- How you use AI tools effectively and critically
- How you handle unknowns, errors, and iteration
- Your ability to explain tradeoffs and your process clearly

## What to Submit

- A link to your screen recording of the session
- A GitHub or Gitlab repo with your code
- A short README (1–2 paragraphs) that includes:
  - Instructions for running the app
  - A brief description of your approach
  - What AI tools you used and how
  - Anything that didn't go as planned or you'd improve with more time
