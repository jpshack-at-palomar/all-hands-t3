1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,010
Alright, let's start that clock here.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,310
Alright, you have three hours.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,630
Clock, there we go. Um, and it's

4
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:19,270
my opportunity to, uh, today to apply for a role at,

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,850
uh, all hands.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,824
And we're gonna I'm going to do that with, that coding exercise.

7
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:27,964
Umm, that has been assigned.

8
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:31,984
Let me just let everybody know who I am here.

9
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:36,604
This is, uh, you probably don't need a picture because you see me right

10
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:39,304
now, but just so you remember who I am.

11
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:43,244
Um, I'm John Shackleford, currently working,

12
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:46,184
um, independently with, um,

13
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:49,668
Palomar Digital. Um. Um, my own little startup,

14
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:53,008
uh, with a former colleague of mine. And,

15
00:00:53,668 --> 00:00:56,448
um, today we're going to be doing tic-tac-toe.

16
00:00:56,928 --> 00:01:00,148
Alright. So, um,

17
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:03,988
I think what I want to do,

18
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:09,468
I'm going to divide my three hours into six,

19
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:11,988
thirty minute chunks. And the very first one,

20
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,912
on is going to be mostly about, you know,

21
00:01:14,932 --> 00:01:19,252
getting things set up and getting the foundations laid for real productivity.

22
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:24,932
And then, the last thirty minutes is going to be for kind of final

23
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:28,072
polish and make sure we get to the end of something that's worth showing.

24
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:31,612
Um, and, uh,

25
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:36,436
so that gives me, you know, really four thirty minute chunks to- it,

26
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,936
um, great features in. So I want to talk a little bit about my

27
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:43,516
approach to the project. Um, but,

28
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:48,556
while I do that, and while I can prepare some other notes about the

29
00:01:48,557 --> 00:01:52,616
project, I want an agent running in the background to make the best use

30
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:55,696
of time. So, I'm going to start by getting,

31
00:01:56,136 --> 00:02:00,296
um, the first bit going, and then we'll come back and look at,

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,760
Umm, my approach to the project and,

33
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,360
and that sort of thing. Okay. So first what I'm going to do is,

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,940
um, do a little voice recording,

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,040
and, and that'll just make it easier for me to prompt,

36
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,800
um, AI for the first bit.

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,840
So I'm using a little utility that's part of the Limsie Suite I've been

38
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,360
working on, and,

39
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:28,004
we just want the speech command,

40
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:30,484
or the recording command,

41
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:33,844
and, uh, just make sure I remember how to do it.

42
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:37,484
Oh, let's see. Are we using the wrong?

43
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:45,004
Alright, let's see if that works.

44
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:49,868
Alright, so, Umm,

45
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:52,708
dash F, and dash meter?

46
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:57,388
Okay. ,ish F,

47
00:02:57,728 --> 00:03:02,468
and then we'll put it on the desktop. And this will be my

48
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:06,488
umm,

49
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:10,888
Oh, it's okay. Alright.

50
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:13,012
All right. Umm,

51
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,612
so we're going to be building a tic-tac-toe game,

52
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:22,132
and the first thing that we want to do is get the model classes

53
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,832
right. And umm,

54
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:29,992
I want to keep the model separate from other functions,

55
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:32,652
umm, because this could get incorporated,

56
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:35,992
umm, into lots of different.

57
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,676
You know, possible projects. So,

58
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:41,196
no display logic, just the model.

59
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:44,336
And umm, we want to use, uhh, vtest,

60
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:49,836
and umm, we want to use umm,

61
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:53,096
the latest, umm, LTS version of node.

62
00:03:54,196 --> 00:03:57,576
And umm, I'm going to be using uhh,

63
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:01,600
uhh, a template project to- use MPM,

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,460
or PMPM, umm,

65
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,180
to set up, umm, monorepo,

66
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,860
because we're likely have a number of different components.

67
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,380
Let's talk about the model for the FixActo game.

68
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,680
So we're going to need umm,

69
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,860
something that represents the game board, and umm,

70
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,680
the game state, and umm, history of the turns that are taken uhh,

71
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,444
uhh, we're going to need a player, and we're going to need umm,

72
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:32,464
a way for different players to play,

73
00:04:33,324 --> 00:04:35,804
human players, umm, different AI players,

74
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:39,144
and so on. So we want to make sure that umm,

75
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:42,504
that the model is flexible and allows for umm,

76
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:45,104
that, and that, that, uhh,

77
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:48,744
uhh, that the API easily accom- .

78
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:52,288
It's, umm, different turn takers. Umm,

79
00:04:52,568 --> 00:04:57,228
I'm trying to think of there are any other things that we

80
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:01,508
need to think about. Umm, we'll have a couple of different AI's to start

81
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,888
with. We'll have a random turn taker that just takes the first available turn.

82
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:09,408
Or, you know, a random of, of the available turns.

83
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:12,808
Umm, and,

84
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:16,492
Umm, the other thing I think is kind of interesting is,

85
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:20,352
you know, how do you compute the best move in tic-tac-toe?

86
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:23,072
You know, if it were a more complicated game,

87
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:27,052
you would use like a red black tree or something like that to kind

88
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:31,292
of like, you know, find the best move for something like tic-tac-toe.

89
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,952
There's really only eight ways to win.

90
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,872
So, um, it would be not,

91
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:39,816
Nice if we could get, um,

92
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:45,056
some output analysis to

93
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:48,996
help us with, um, kind of that,

94
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,776
the action space versus the,

95
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:54,396
you know, the game environment and, um,

96
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:58,216
so, um,

97
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:00,936
knowing, you know, what the available,

98
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,850
turn options are, it would be important.

99
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,850
Um, I think I also want to have, like,

100
00:06:06,851 --> 00:06:12,270
a grid system so that you could easily refer to turns with,

101
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,810
like, letters representing columns, numbers representing rows.

102
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,370
Um, what else do we want in there?

103
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,954
Um, I'm trying to

104
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,774
think of anything else we need to think about.

105
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:36,854
For tic-tac-toe. Oh,

106
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:39,594
yeah, I know. It would be kind of nice to have,

107
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:42,114
um,

108
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:45,574
a function in our game engine that would,

109
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:50,948
umm, that would- tell us sort of what the-

110
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,268
available,

111
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:58,468
you know, what-what the next best moves are for

112
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:00,828
each player, you know, in-in ranked order.

113
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:04,468
Um, and-and in other words, like, uh,

114
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:07,528
you know, here's a move that could win in one turn.

115
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:10,588
Here's a move that could end in two-win in two turns.

116
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:13,672
Here's a move that would-could win in- three turns,

117
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:15,872
um, so that you could, you know,

118
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:19,752
kind of rank them that way. Um, that might be,

119
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:25,352
uh, kind of duplicate from- what

120
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:28,212
you would do with a red black tree if we ever use such a

121
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:33,832
thing. Um, trying to think if there's any other core

122
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,112
ideas we need in the item.

123
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:38,996
I don't. I don't think so. Okay,

124
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:41,836
so this is going to go in the lib directory, um,

125
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:45,576
of our packages directory in our,

126
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:48,336
um, in our project.

127
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:53,436
Okay, I think that's enough. And now let's,

128
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:59,776
uh, go ahead and see

129
00:07:59,777 --> 00:08:02,640
if we can- sorry for moving. and just a little picture around.

130
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,280
So, oh.

131
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,860
That's time. There it is.

132
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,360
There it is. Okay. So,

133
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,960
uh, let's go ahead and make a code directory for this.

134
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,734
Make sure. Code.

135
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:44,904
Actually, I want to do it like this.

136
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:45,124
Yes.

137
00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:07,458
And, we're gonna open up cursor,

138
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:12,778
and we're gonna- and

139
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:12,938
I.

140
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,856
It's a goodness I'm showing up.

141
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:50,186
That's interesting.

142
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:58,606
Alright, let me just, whoa,

143
00:09:58,786 --> 00:09:59,506
no, don't do that!

144
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,420
I'll just do it like this. I'm gonna create a little dog folder

145
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:24,080
here. There.

146
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:38,034
And, bring that in

147
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:42,874
there. Okay. And that's the original

148
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,994
set of instructions that we received.

149
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:49,694
So now I should be able to. Got it.

150
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,548
It'll be referenced by active type. Okay. So the next thing I want to

151
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:56,268
do is,

152
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:58,668
umm,

153
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:02,508
let's have the agent think about that for a minute.

154
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:23,582
Now, it will do some summarizing.

155
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:28,082
But while it's doing that, what I want to do is find a design

156
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:32,402
document that I have a specific format I like to use for design documents.

157
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:37,822
So, I'm going to try.

158
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:40,196
I'm going to find a good example.

159
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,116
And, let's see,

160
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:48,436
I think, in the Allen project I have.

161
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,916
A bunch of,

162
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:52,276
um.

163
00:11:56,896 --> 00:12:01,896
And, I think this one for,

164
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,470
I think it was something that would have been a different branch.

165
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,130
Yeah, yeah. This,

166
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,690
this branch is a little better.

167
00:12:23,691 --> 00:12:24,010
There we go.

168
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:33,264
Huh. Why is it not letting me click?

169
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:40,244
Alright. Yeah,

170
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:42,924
I think like this one,

171
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:47,084
a conversation history. I thought I had an M2 in here that was good.

172
00:12:48,444 --> 00:12:51,728
Oh, I'll bet that's in a different branch. M2 branch.

173
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:59,528
Okay. I mean, these are all pretty much the same,

174
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:02,448
but umm, this one came out pretty well.

175
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:09,688
Umm. Umm. Umm.

176
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:13,348
Umm. Start on the A design.

177
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:38,012
Actually, let's get that from the template.

178
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:42,656
But. That I'm gonna use. Think if I go back to

179
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:46,776
GitHub. Umm,

180
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:50,836
aaand, kind of my repositories.

181
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:57,696
PMPM template. This is just a nice template that already

182
00:13:57,697 --> 00:14:00,116
has my GitHub workflow. And,

183
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:03,720
you know, tools I like to use. You Alrighty to go.

184
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,560
So, I can get started easier with that.

185
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,220
I wasn't sure if doing that would be cheating. Umm,

186
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,200
to use that template. But I did ask Ash.

187
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,140
I think I have a little picture. You should've said.

188
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,320
Basically, she said. It's okay.

189
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,204
So, thank you, Ash. Umm.

190
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:36,984
Alright. So,

191
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:39,064
there is our repo structure. sure

192
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,618
Alright. So now,

193
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:58,358
let me give it that design dock.

194
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:09,258
Okay. Here

195
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:13,598
is the um, design dock format.

196
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:18,252
I like it. I like to

197
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:22,652
use. Uhm,

198
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:30,252
please stop at the end

199
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:32,432
of section 2,

200
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:38,472
because we will do-

201
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:41,316
discuss. And then,

202
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:44,376
um, where-where is that document gonna go?

203
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:49,876
Let's put it in tic-tac-toe.

204
00:15:50,176 --> 00:15:52,396
Let's call-let's call tic-tac-toe T3. Okay.

205
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:57,776
Um, and we're gonna put that in the-and we'll

206
00:15:57,777 --> 00:15:59,916
just say.

207
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,620
Alright. And that'll keep it busy for a bit.

208
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,854
Because there's quite a bit to that. That, um, design document.

209
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:31,314
And now I think we can talk about,

210
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:34,374
kind of my whole approach to this problem.

211
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:39,214
And, um, so I'm gonna do another recording. To capture that.

212
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:44,874
And, um, I don't know. Just,

213
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,234
bring up a record again.

214
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,094
Let me see.

215
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:11,448
Okay. So now we're talking about the project as a whole.

216
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,548
So, um. I'm,

217
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:17,212
One of the things that, umm,

218
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:22,332
you'll notice in the technical assessment is that,

219
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,452
you know, the time limit is really critical. And for me,

220
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:29,032
that will be the biggest challenge. It's sort of balancing. How do I slow

221
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:31,452
down and show, like, that I know,

222
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,092
engineering disciplines? Um, and,

223
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:38,132
you know, actually I'm fast enough to be productive.

224
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:41,816
You know, I think the biggest thing is, like, avoiding tarpets because,

225
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:46,136
um, it doesn't take much to sink three hours if you get stuck on

226
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:49,156
something. So, having this, you know,

227
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,256
every 30 minutes stop is gonna help me.

228
00:17:51,556 --> 00:17:55,256
In fact, how am I doing on time? I'm accidentally paused it.

229
00:17:56,056 --> 00:18:01,016
Unpause. Um, so,

230
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:03,420
how am I doing? So,

231
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,400
I guess I've got just a few minutes left.

232
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,000
Um, now, um,

233
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,040
okay, let's talk about, ah, anyway.

234
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,340
Uh, it says here you could do a

235
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:23,380
basic, simple front end. You could do a CLI.

236
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,540
You could do a back end.

237
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:30,854
Umm, API. You could do a containerized deployment.

238
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:34,114
You could deploy it, and so on. Okay, so, thank for me.

239
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:36,794
The main thing is, you have to have something,

240
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:40,334
right? It has to be a playable tic-tac-toe game. And so,

241
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:44,174
I think our goal is to be able to reduce risk in this project

242
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:48,154
by get to something playable as fast as possible.

243
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:51,928
And then make it better or do con- and interesting projects,

244
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:56,088
um, you know, after that basic part was done.

245
00:18:56,648 --> 00:19:00,608
So, what would be like the most basic implementation of tic-tac-toe?

246
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:05,188
Well, um, I was recently playing tic-tac-toe with my kids in the car on

247
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:07,848
a long trip. Uh, I was trying to keep them busy,

248
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:11,808
and so we decided that we would try like like mental tic-tac-toe,

249
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:15,048
you know, where you didn't actually get,

250
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,332
See the board, you just said, you know, A1,

251
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:20,392
you know, B2, and so on.

252
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:24,232
And, um, that was a lot of fun for them, for the younger ones.

253
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:27,452
And, um, that would be simple.

254
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,832
We wouldn't have to think about any kind of layout, or presentation,

255
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:32,212
or, you know. As long as the game engine works,

256
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,932
and you can, you know,

257
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:38,252
give your moves, and simple, you know,

258
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:41,476
roll. role. We'll call them type, or column row type format,

259
00:19:41,536 --> 00:19:46,316
then you're fine. Um, so I think that's the first implementation.

260
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:49,116
And, of course, the whole library is,

261
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:51,856
is then there. And then we could start doing other things.

262
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:54,816
We could do a React app, um,

263
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:58,616
or more sophisticated CLI version,

264
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:02,316
or something like that. I mean, things I would really love to do are,

265
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,340
like, the- voice, um,

266
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,020
voice-activated. That could be done either from the command line,

267
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,000
or it could be done in the browser using the kind of voice libraries

268
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,220
that are built into browsers nowadays. Um.

269
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,700
I mean, what I would love to do, actually, is have it on Apple

270
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:22,540
TV, and, um, like,

271
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,780
have your phone be the microphone,

272
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:27,020
you know, and so you could actually- Actually,

273
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:29,964
Play it talking to your phone, and then have it show up on Apple

274
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:32,344
TV. There's no way I'm doing that in three hours, so.

275
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,784
As much as I'd like to do that, that's off the table.

276
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:38,984
Uh, another thing that would be really cool,

277
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:44,424
be to do, like, a touch screen, Raspberry Pi,

278
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:49,404
you know, device. And I think I've got a touch screen that

279
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:52,028
I could use, and I could steal John Andrew's- Andrew. Just Raspberry Pi,

280
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:56,688
that would be fun. But that also is not gonna fit

281
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,008
in three hours, probably. So, um,

282
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:02,148
they're just limits to what we're gonna be able to do with the time

283
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:04,948
we've got. I think the main thing is,

284
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:09,548
um, if we do go down the React kind of road is like

285
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:12,448
there's all kinds of carpets you could fall into there. Um,

286
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:15,248
so let's, you know, be very careful about that.

287
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:19,202
Yeah. But we should be able to get the first thing up and going

288
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:21,902
in the first iteration or two. Okay.

289
00:21:22,662 --> 00:21:25,082
So that's kind of how I'm thinking about this.

290
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:28,682
Um, I understand,

291
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:32,022
my understanding, let's talk about my understanding of what they want.

292
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:35,422
Um, yeah,

293
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:38,682
I want something playable. They want to see my process in the way I'm

294
00:21:38,683 --> 00:21:42,356
thinking. Okay, I'm doing that right now, so, um,

295
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,896
hopefully they can read a transcript or summarize a transcript.

296
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,936
That's even better because this is being awfully long through your hours.

297
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:51,516
Um, what else?

298
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:54,476
Um, rules.

299
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,636
I talked about the clarification I got from Ash.

300
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:03,156
Any other sort of assumptions I'm making about rules that I should communicate?

301
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:05,240
Give me a kick. I think, uh,

302
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,800
an important one is I- there's nothing in the rules that says I can't

303
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:14,520
borrow code from other projects that I have worked on previously.

304
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,580
And, um, so I'll do that. Um,

305
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,300
my son and I have been writing little games all

306
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,260
summer, so there should be stuff to draw on.

307
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:32,524
Umm, any other rule assumptions I should communicate.

308
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:38,624
I don't think so. I think we're good. I think balancing the time

309
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,824
versus, like,

310
00:22:41,524 --> 00:22:44,804
showing. I mean, one of the things they talk about here is using an

311
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:46,984
AI credically. So don't just,

312
00:22:46,985 --> 00:22:49,704
like, accept the output. Obviously,

313
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:52,268
you know. It's garbage in,

314
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:54,748
garbage out with the AI tools anyway, so, um,

315
00:22:55,008 --> 00:22:57,348
hopefully I can demonstrate that just as part of my natural workflow,

316
00:22:57,349 --> 00:23:00,448
but I do need to be cognizant of that.

317
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:04,448
Okay, I think I've done all the thinking I need to do about how

318
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:08,368
I'm gonna approach the problem. Maybe we should be more specific about milestones.

319
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:12,388
stones. So milestone one is all about kind of getting the lip going,

320
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:14,768
getting our first, you know,

321
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:19,352
push in into GitHub, getting our workflows running,

322
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:23,112
you know, basic infrastructure. Interation two,

323
00:23:24,452 --> 00:23:27,052
like dead simple command line version,

324
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:30,652
or doesn't even have to have a command line interface if I can kick

325
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:33,152
it off. But it has to be playable tic-tac-toe.

326
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,612
I think we're gonna do that by just no display.

327
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:41,576
Mental tic-tac-toe. Umm. And against a random player,

328
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:44,356
right? Um, that's milestone, uh,

329
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,716
two. And then, milestone three,

330
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,936
and four, um, and five,

331
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:53,836
couldn't be, uh, about, like, more sophisticated CLI,

332
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:57,156
or react, or, and I think the way that I'm gonna approach that is,

333
00:23:57,556 --> 00:23:59,756
I'm gonna build design documents for everything.

334
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:02,736
Um, and then,

335
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:05,060
I'm going- Thank much for joining me. To, um,

336
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,640
run a bunch of those through,

337
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:11,160
um, a cursor agent in parallel,

338
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,420
and, you know,

339
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,520
we'll take what we get, you know, we'll take the good stuff from the

340
00:24:18,521 --> 00:24:21,220
output we get, and we'll discard the rest,

341
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,300
and we'll just, you know,

342
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,100
try to end with something good by, uh, being selective about,

343
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,964
um. . . what we pull in and what we think we can finish

344
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:33,704
and polish. Um, but we won't be, like,

345
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:36,664
I think taking some risks is okay,

346
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,704
we just gotta be very careful about time-boxing.

347
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:41,964
Okay, I've talked enough about all this,

348
00:24:42,504 --> 00:24:44,864
and I hope I'm still recording.

349
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:47,544
Looks like it. Alright,

350
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:51,684
so now, I should have an approach.

351
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:54,688
How much. Uh,

352
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:55,788
transcript here.

353
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:02,908
Not nearly as many words as you would think it would be.

354
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,608
Uhm, for as much time as it took. So,

355
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:13,308
let's uh, turn.

356
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:57,396
Now, let's look at, um, what happened with our other design document here.

357
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:04,136
Alright. So we-

358
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,800
We've got the problem statement, post solution,

359
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,880
demo implementation standards.

360
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,700
Uhh, uhh, okay,

361
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,580
there's stuff about demos that I think can be removed.

362
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,674
Good assumptions. I'm sure I'm on this. Or a few board

363
00:26:30,675 --> 00:26:33,574
moving illnesses. Okay,

364
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:39,594
here's our classes. Game

365
00:26:39,595 --> 00:26:43,694
board, game state player. Game engine move analyzer.

366
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:49,974
Umm. Not sure

367
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,628
if I see anything that represents the actions. 4 4 5 Space.

368
00:26:56,188 --> 00:26:59,828
And, Oh, you know, I never told it that we were doing TypeScript.

369
00:27:00,728 --> 00:27:04,668
That was not good. Sorry.

370
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:09,368
It's an easy fix later. Okay,

371
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:15,208
so let's interact here. How

372
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:20,172
will we get- at the action space from

373
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:22,492
the current state?

374
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:44,966
Okay, great.

375
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:02,516
I'm gonna make some improvements. I'm gonna move this around.

376
00:28:02,736 --> 00:28:06,150
I'm sorry that I keep moving this little bubble around. I have to be

377
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,270
able to see what's going on here. Umm,

378
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,970
uhh, so,

379
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,330
I'm not seeing what you actually changed here.

380
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,190
Did you?

381
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:43,164
Okay. Okay,

382
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:46,344
good. Alright, so now,

383
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:51,344
What's,

384
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,988
actions from the template are left.

385
00:28:55,548 --> 00:28:55,988
left.

386
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:38,502
1, 2, 3 and 4. I'm a little bit more.

387
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:50,736
Okay, while it's doing that, let's clone our template repo and

388
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:53,116
get going with that bit.

389
00:29:56,296 --> 00:30:00,936
Alright, so where is that template repo?

390
00:30:01,956 --> 00:30:07,380
Oh, it's right here. I must have pulled

391
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:11,920
it up a moment ago, okay. So,

392
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,840
I guess what I could do is just,

393
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,400
let's say I used this template, create a new repository.

394
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,340
And we're gonna call this open plugins T.

395
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:32,164
Two. Two. Two. Three. Umm,

396
00:30:32,504 --> 00:30:37,944
and we're gonna make it private. And

397
00:30:37,945 --> 00:30:43,744
we're gonna just create it. And we'll just say that this is our take

398
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:47,724
assessment project. Alright,

399
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:52,384
there we go. Getting worried about the time.

400
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:55,088
fine. Oh, we're almost at the end of the first section.

401
00:30:57,528 --> 00:31:02,408
Okay. So here's our all hands T3

402
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:06,428
project. And I'm gonna get cloned that.

403
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:18,582
Okay. And now,

404
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:22,222
I'm gonna copy.

405
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:29,842
This are the tic-tac-toe docs

406
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:33,442
directory into the new repo.

407
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:40,002
Cause that's where we're gonna work from now on. Oh,

408
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:40,922
it was T3.0.

409
00:31:57,586 --> 00:32:03,946
All of our docs there. Alright, great. All

410
00:32:03,947 --> 00:32:07,660
right, now, of course, it's still working on the design doc,

411
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:10,740
so I'm gonna have to do that again, actually. Umm.

412
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,040
But, that's okay. It doesn't stop us from making sure that

413
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:20,240
the tests run. Oh,

414
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,720
we have to install everything,

415
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,940
right? Oh,

416
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,954
okay. Let's look at the template. What am I doing wrong here?

417
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:35,634
Pnpm, let's don't, uhm.

418
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:42,494
Okay. And,

419
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:45,854
set up the GitHub Hux.

420
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:53,214
Okay, great. And then let's run.

421
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,808
And the build.

422
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:02,708
And then let's just do,

423
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:05,048
Let's just go straight to the test.

424
00:33:05,628 --> 00:33:06,388
Pnpm test.

425
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:39,632
Great, test ran. And so.

426
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:42,626
Oh. Stavis.

427
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:54,716
Uhm. Let's actually.

428
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:54,936
Finally.

429
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,940
And we're just gonna say.

430
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,820
Look at the. Docks.

431
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,540
We want to look at the read me.

432
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,364
Read me and. time. We want to look at the.

433
00:34:30,624 --> 00:34:34,084
This is hard on the eyes. Ahhh. Okay.

434
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:38,004
And we want to look also at our approach stock.

435
00:34:39,864 --> 00:34:44,424
Approach stock. And maybe we

436
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:47,744
should also include the assignment.

437
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:55,898
Umm. Mm. Just that drop in

438
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:56,098
there.

439
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:05,778
Is that- is that seeing it? I'm not sure it's seeing it.

440
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:12,278
Is it in the dark folder? Oh.

441
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:12,398
No.

442
00:35:20,272 --> 00:35:21,392
Let's also include that.

443
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:36,822
And then say, let's update the readme.

444
00:35:40,002 --> 00:35:44,096
Keeping. Keeping. Dev.

445
00:35:44,556 --> 00:35:46,636
Workflow. But.

446
00:35:47,556 --> 00:35:49,636
Adding. Initial.

447
00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:04,996
Okay, great. We're gonna get out.

448
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:08,070
Yeah. Alright.

449
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,570
How are we doing? It's working on our design.

450
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:18,190
It's good. Now,

451
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:23,010
wait a minute. I can see.

452
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,904
There's a bunch of changes up here. Yeah.

453
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:38,284
It did successfully get rid of the demo stuff we didn't want.

454
00:36:42,164 --> 00:36:48,284
But I'm not seeing, did it actually give us all the testing content

455
00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:49,204
that we want?

456
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:58,708
Can you imagine an actual space?

457
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:01,808
I was having it, um,

458
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:08,308
I have trouble with

459
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,768
the edit tools today. For some reason,

460
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,168
it's just really struggling with the edit tools today. Yeah,

461
00:37:13,169 --> 00:37:17,928
so a lot of this content is missing. So,

462
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:21,192
Let's see, can we just apply it?

463
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:22,912
No. Copy it.

464
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:33,572
Okay, so I'm just gonna copy it.

465
00:37:36,332 --> 00:37:40,252
Oh, good, and there's the section 4 content too.

466
00:37:40,912 --> 00:37:41,352
Great.

467
00:37:45,576 --> 00:37:48,216
And, looks like it did have some kind of edit problem.

468
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:53,516
So what I'm gonna do is just let it know that there's an

469
00:37:53,517 --> 00:37:54,196
edit problem.

470
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:03,096
Looks like,

471
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:13,280
was a problem applying edits in

472
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:20,700
the middle of the dark between,

473
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:24,180
I'll just say here. So it has line references.

474
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,900
So if we do it like this, it'll get the line references,

475
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,624
it'll know where to look. Okay.

476
00:38:39,374 --> 00:38:43,954
And umm, let's see how our bell is done over

477
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:47,074
here. Let's see. Oh, we were working on the read me.

478
00:38:47,314 --> 00:38:50,614
Let's go back to the, Where is the read me?

479
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:54,174
It's in a different instance of cursor which,

480
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,848
Which is where. No.

481
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:08,448
Here's our read me. Here's our new read me content.

482
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:13,728
Let's fix all the lint errors. Pretty particular.

483
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:16,588
But yeah, it doesn't care, but I care.

484
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,642
Okay. It's how we're good.

485
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:27,702
So let's get this bit

486
00:39:27,703 --> 00:39:29,062
out of the read me. See you.

487
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:46,936
And there's no new content because we started from a clone.

488
00:39:47,396 --> 00:39:49,176
Okay. Get.

489
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:04,056
And what are we saying? We're saying we updated the reading.

490
00:40:04,316 --> 00:40:08,350
That's it. Read me. First.

491
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,280
So Husky's working. Now we're pushing.

492
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,520
And we'll see if our GitHub project works.

493
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,140
Okay. Umm.

494
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:34,744
on Alright, let's see how our little

495
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:37,004
dock is coming here. It looks like they deleted those lines.

496
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:42,364
Good. What's down here? These are just basic little lint

497
00:40:42,365 --> 00:40:44,004
errors. We can give it off.

498
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:57,568
And, It did not follow the,

499
00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:01,708
It's interesting that it, um,

500
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:06,748
If followed the template well enough to know that it's supposed to identify implementation

501
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:12,288
and test steps, but it's also supposed to include test

502
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:13,468
files. miles.

503
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:23,262
And, um, so I'm gonna tell it to do that.

504
00:41:28,202 --> 00:41:32,122
Actually, this might be a good time to switch over to our new project.

505
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:38,322
So, a moment ago I did a little copy operation

506
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:43,536
here. Where was that? So

507
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:46,416
let's just do that. Let's be specific,

508
00:41:46,776 --> 00:41:48,376
because we've only changed one file.

509
00:41:56,856 --> 00:42:01,156
That's gonna go in the dock. Okay.

510
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:05,476
And now from now on, we're not gonna be in this project.

511
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,780
We're gonna be in this one, right? Are we?

512
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:17,220
Yes. Okay.

513
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,560
Now, this is in my way,

514
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,860
sorry. Um, okay.

515
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,780
Let's,

516
00:42:35,024 --> 00:42:36,864
Let's have it fix this document. Thank you very much for your

517
00:43:15,538 --> 00:43:17,678
And that should be in, uhm,

518
00:43:18,218 --> 00:43:21,712
ehm. I could just lib, source,

519
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:24,952
uhm,

520
00:43:24,953 --> 00:43:28,232
test. Uhm,

521
00:43:31,152 --> 00:43:36,132
be sure our tests are using v-test.

522
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:36,512
Next.

523
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:45,796
And, uhm,

524
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:47,196
our checklist section.

525
00:43:57,956 --> 00:44:02,536
Every sub section should have

526
00:44:02,537 --> 00:44:06,236
both code implementations.

527
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,400
Let's let it fix that dock. And let's

528
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:21,180
see how our build did. So here's our all

529
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:23,680
hands T3 project. Let's go to GitHub actions.

530
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,020
And, good.

531
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,100
Sweet.

532
00:44:32,364 --> 00:44:34,824
Test results. Yes,

533
00:44:35,224 --> 00:44:39,324
good. Co-coverage reports.

534
00:44:39,325 --> 00:44:39,544
words.

535
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:01,618
Okay, great. That's what we want to see.

536
00:45:05,178 --> 00:45:07,078
So, what's next?

537
00:45:11,998 --> 00:45:14,138
Sorry, build is good. We just,

538
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:16,298
we need this design dark to wrap up.

539
00:45:17,258 --> 00:45:19,372
Then we'll give that to an agent, and then we'll start working- right on

540
00:45:19,373 --> 00:45:21,972
the design docks for the other pieces.

541
00:45:23,092 --> 00:45:25,492
So, how are we doing on time here? Well, we,

542
00:45:25,732 --> 00:45:28,432
we finished our first iteration.

543
00:45:29,272 --> 00:45:32,212
We're halfway through the second one. Um,

544
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:36,352
I feel like we're running behind by maybe 15,

545
00:45:36,372 --> 00:45:39,632
20 minutes of where I want it to be, but I think we'll,

546
00:45:39,752 --> 00:45:40,812
we'll be, we'll be alright.

547
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:49,176
Let's see how these dark edits are going.

548
00:45:49,896 --> 00:45:53,876
Good, good. This is what I want to see. Full file paths.

549
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:59,176
Um, you can save a ton of problems when you're,

550
00:45:59,396 --> 00:46:01,696
you know, generating code, um,

551
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:06,596
in a batch by being very specific about,

552
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,570
the, uh, the files, where they are.

553
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,370
Umm, cause, ha. Stupid,

554
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:18,070
it's really stupid things that can get the agent confused and waste a lot

555
00:46:18,071 --> 00:46:20,130
of cycles, like, it'll get there eventually,

556
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,110
but it might take way more turns than necessary.

557
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,890
Some of these don't have changes yet.

558
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,370
Oh, okay. There's, there's, they're kind of,

559
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,504
it's gonna workin' through. I'm not through. Slowly workin' through the doc.

560
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:38,244
Getting those files. And so it hasn't gotten to the checklist section,

561
00:46:38,444 --> 00:46:43,504
which is what I'm really concerned about. That's super important to

562
00:46:43,505 --> 00:46:47,184
have, woah, a really strong checklist section.

563
00:46:48,824 --> 00:46:50,284
That's where the magic happens.

564
00:46:57,708 --> 00:47:00,028
Umm, sometimes when it's doing test strategy stuff,

565
00:47:00,128 --> 00:47:03,088
it just says, like, really general stuff it already knows.

566
00:47:03,428 --> 00:47:07,788
That's not very helpful. It's much better if it's actually,

567
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:10,188
it's more specific.

568
00:47:22,192 --> 00:47:23,212
Umm. You

569
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:11,760
This is taking a long time. . . Well,

570
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,680
I gotta know what I've expected.

571
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,620
Okay. So there's enough here that I can open

572
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:32,914
a new tab. And say,

573
00:48:33,534 --> 00:48:38,474
what to create a new dot.

574
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:38,574
. .

575
00:50:04,236 --> 00:50:07,516
It looks like this thing is ready to go. I'm seeing.

576
00:50:07,517 --> 00:50:09,940
Teen. Test.

577
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:11,780
That's good.

578
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:22,630
Oftentimes the last parts of a checklist,

579
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:26,710
it's funny. It's like a human in the sense that,

580
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:31,510
you know, we understand the stuff that's

581
00:50:31,511 --> 00:50:34,564
near to it. And the stuff that's a little further out is kind of

582
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:38,124
hand wavy. And, um, almost always when writing these documents,

583
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:40,204
the AI will, like,

584
00:50:40,544 --> 00:50:45,144
append to the end, like, considerations about performance or security,

585
00:50:45,284 --> 00:50:48,364
or, you know, boilerplate stuff it's seen in other design docs.

586
00:50:48,844 --> 00:50:52,624
But it's just boilerplate. Like, there's no actual meaningful content besides the boiler,

587
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:56,024
um, plate stuff. And that's kind of what's happening here.

588
00:50:56,025 --> 00:51:00,228
. Here is, you know, says we should have API documentation.

589
00:51:00,968 --> 00:51:03,248
Okay. Well, we're actually building that right now. So,

590
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:05,928
I'm not gonna bother with this. All this,

591
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,948
kind of, final validation stuff.

592
00:51:08,128 --> 00:51:10,588
It's very hand wavy. And I'm just gonna delete it all.

593
00:51:11,528 --> 00:51:15,048
That, that is a pretty typical pattern with these.

594
00:51:17,628 --> 00:51:18,608
But this stuff is good.

595
00:51:25,492 --> 00:51:27,612
Integration testing, testing infrastructure.

596
00:51:29,092 --> 00:51:31,892
This stuff, we're not gonna need it. We're not gonna need this.

597
00:51:33,112 --> 00:51:37,692
That's done. Integration

598
00:51:37,693 --> 00:51:41,952
test directory. Sure.

599
00:51:42,972 --> 00:51:43,852
Let's do integration testing.

600
00:51:49,136 --> 00:51:51,436
Okay. That seems reasonable.

601
00:51:53,016 --> 00:51:55,476
It seems reasonable.

602
00:51:56,796 --> 00:51:58,876
And if there are big problems with the design,

603
00:51:59,256 --> 00:52:02,296
it will come out. Pretty quick.

604
00:52:02,436 --> 00:52:04,876
Pretty quick. So at this point,

605
00:52:05,016 --> 00:52:08,296
I think we are ready to have an agent's,

606
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,920
start building that out. So we are going

607
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:17,640
to go in the background mode. And we are going to tell it,

608
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,160
oops. Umm,

609
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,020
implement. Doc.

610
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:29,360
What did we call this? Just. Come on.

611
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,100
Pop, pop, pop, pop. Shh.

612
00:52:38,064 --> 00:52:43,264
Umm, completing each sub

613
00:52:43,265 --> 00:52:48,744
section of the check list

614
00:52:48,745 --> 00:52:51,004
e4. See,

615
00:52:51,224 --> 00:52:53,064
two. Next. Next.

616
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:00,138
In sharing. Test.

617
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:02,758
Pass. And.

618
00:53:18,818 --> 00:53:20,478
Uhm. Mm. Mm.

619
00:53:27,342 --> 00:53:28,102
You complete them.

620
00:53:36,782 --> 00:53:39,422
Uhm, and then what do you need to do? You need to, uhm,

621
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:43,462
commit and push one.

622
00:53:44,576 --> 00:53:49,236
It's green for

623
00:53:49,237 --> 00:53:52,696
every subsection.

624
00:53:53,776 --> 00:53:56,316
uhh, uhh, uhh,

625
00:53:56,936 --> 00:54:00,156
uhh, uhh, uhh, and we need to push two.

626
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:00,316
Yeah.

627
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,060
This.

628
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:30,040
Is there anything else? I feel like I'm forgetting something that it always messes

629
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:32,520
up, but I'm not. It's not.

630
00:54:32,844 --> 00:54:36,844
Oh, I know our agent is probably not set up.

631
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:42,244
So we need to go in here. It needs to know

632
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:43,084
about our repo.

633
00:54:48,564 --> 00:54:50,684
Umm, umm. Mm-hmm.

634
00:55:03,698 --> 00:55:06,738
Oh, I wonder if we actually got the,

635
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:09,378
No, I don't think so.

636
00:55:12,998 --> 00:55:17,558
Yeah, I'm not seeing the cursor file that sh-has the agent set up.

637
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:17,558
up.

638
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:44,862
I live dangerously. I-I use the,

639
00:55:44,896 --> 00:55:47,276
the beta versions of, umm,

640
00:55:48,096 --> 00:55:51,036
cursor, so, like, new stuff comes out all the time.

641
00:55:51,696 --> 00:55:54,576
Sometimes it's broken, and this might be one of those times.

642
00:55:56,716 --> 00:55:59,476
Uh-huh. Let's see if this will do it.

643
00:56:04,836 --> 00:56:06,856
Good. Saw that.

644
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,080
Oh, yeah, I gotta come in and push that.

645
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,240
Get add.cursor.

646
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,760
Uhh, let's see. Oh,

647
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,360
it's because it's at the wrong level,

648
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,904
probably. No, it isn't. Which,

649
00:56:33,905 --> 00:56:36,304
where are we? Oh,

650
00:56:36,584 --> 00:56:37,724
I'm at the wrong level.

651
00:56:45,754 --> 00:56:48,374
There we go. Status.

652
00:56:51,614 --> 00:56:54,434
I think we can, we can add our dock to.

653
00:56:56,274 --> 00:57:00,348
That's going to be, super important, actually. Let's add the contract stock.

654
00:57:07,548 --> 00:57:10,268
Actually, that's just out of mall. They're all good for now.

655
00:57:10,568 --> 00:57:15,128
I mean, we're going to have to revise some of them still. Uhm,

656
00:57:17,748 --> 00:57:17,748
okay.

657
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,272
Get them in. This is what's called darks.

658
00:57:26,532 --> 00:57:27,092
It's Muslim darks.

659
00:57:49,646 --> 00:57:52,346
Okay. Now.

660
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:57,546
Potentially outdated environment.

661
00:57:58,146 --> 00:57:58,706
That's interesting.

662
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:05,666
Why does it think the environment is outdated?

663
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:19,050
Okay, things are okay. Oh,

664
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,540
that's interesting. What happened? Oh, oh,

665
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,024
oh, I'll be- That is because, umm,

666
00:58:36,144 --> 00:58:38,224
the linter. Hehehe.

667
00:58:39,104 --> 00:58:42,904
Okay. Commit.

668
00:58:42,905 --> 00:58:43,864
And then we're going to of a

669
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:10,408
Alright. There we

670
00:59:10,409 --> 00:59:14,728
go. Repository access required.

671
00:59:15,408 --> 00:59:20,368
Set up. Continue. And.

672
00:59:19,648 --> 00:59:24,182
And, What do you want to

673
00:59:24,183 --> 00:59:27,882
do? Oh, it's all through, okay. Install another address.

674
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,782
You know what? The other thing I'm gonna set up is Google Quotuses.

675
00:59:36,722 --> 00:59:40,742
Where do you want to come to assist today? Quotuses.

676
00:59:43,142 --> 00:59:44,962
GitHub. Install.

677
00:59:49,616 --> 00:59:54,796
Marketplace right here. And they're somewhere installed

678
00:59:54,797 --> 00:59:57,836
for free. Ooh, I picked the wrong account prior.

679
00:59:58,176 --> 00:59:59,096
It doesn't, man.

680
01:00:07,996 --> 01:00:09,476
This is me, I think, right?

681
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:21,960
Select repositories. Sweet.

682
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:38,084
Sweet. Ah. Okay. Alright.

683
01:00:38,644 --> 01:00:42,044
Where are we? So.

684
01:00:43,104 --> 01:00:47,544
Are we pose? There is.

685
01:00:52,644 --> 01:00:57,504
Okay, as I read me, I can't

686
01:00:57,505 --> 01:01:01,568
be in the, template stuff. Okay. And,

687
01:01:01,569 --> 01:01:04,208
I think we had a,

688
01:01:04,209 --> 01:01:07,728
we already verified we have a clean bill. That hasn't changed.

689
01:01:10,428 --> 01:01:13,788
And, pretty soon we're gonna be seeing some pull requests show up here.

690
01:01:14,268 --> 01:01:18,028
Let's see how the umm, let's see how that our little agent is doing.

691
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:22,432
Ooh, background agent not found. That's not good.

692
01:01:23,092 --> 01:01:24,032
What's that all about?

693
01:01:30,212 --> 01:01:31,392
Oh, there it goes.

694
01:01:35,452 --> 01:01:37,012
I just felt the start. All right. All right.

695
01:01:45,856 --> 01:01:48,876
Okay. Sweet. It's working on that.

696
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:53,076
While it starts, I'm going to go turn on the air conditioner for a

697
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:55,976
minute. I hope it's not going to make too much noise for you,

698
01:01:55,996 --> 01:02:00,516
for background, but, um. It's,

699
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:02,936
I'm afraid I'm going to need a little air for just a bit.

700
01:02:03,356 --> 01:02:05,576
Okay. And then, we'll come back and more.

701
01:02:05,736 --> 01:02:07,656
We're going to some design docks. Fox. Mm-mm.

702
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,360
Okay. Hopefully, that's not too noisy for you. Okay.

703
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,800
We're coming up on the end of the,

704
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,120
actually we've blown past the end of our first hour,

705
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,660
so we've got to get bookin'. I wanted to see a tic-tac-toe game by

706
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:32,020
now, and we're still doing, like, a lot of kind of setup activity.

707
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,584
I mean- . Fundamentally,

708
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:39,424
we're laying the groundwork for all that cool stuff that's gonna happen,

709
01:02:39,425 --> 01:02:41,584
so. Umm,

710
01:02:41,664 --> 01:02:45,084
I'm okay. I'm okay with it, but. Alright.

711
01:02:45,984 --> 01:02:48,444
We can put all this aside, not right now.

712
01:02:52,404 --> 01:02:56,984
And. Let's start working on some new design

713
01:02:56,985 --> 01:03:00,248
docks. So,

714
01:03:00,908 --> 01:03:02,808
we want one for this. 2,

715
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:09,788
3, see the line. I'm ready.

716
01:03:13,268 --> 01:03:15,888
And we're gonna want one for,

717
01:03:16,328 --> 01:03:19,448
umm, a react.

718
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:21,888
2, 3.

719
01:03:43,472 --> 01:03:46,052
Fastify server, hmm. Fastify server.

720
01:03:46,053 --> 01:03:50,176
Sir. Okay.

721
01:03:51,456 --> 01:03:55,276
Time's running short, but let's- let's go ahead and-

722
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:11,510
Umm.

723
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,010
Okay, so to fastify,

724
01:04:20,011 --> 01:04:25,030
dark, what's gonna be the best way to write that?

725
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:31,730
I think, the best way for

726
01:04:31,731 --> 01:04:34,984
it to write that, I think that's gonna be- be best done by a

727
01:04:34,985 --> 01:04:38,384
local agent, because I think what I'm gonna have it do,

728
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:44,584
is clone another repo and

729
01:04:44,585 --> 01:04:49,144
look at it. And umm.

730
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:57,684
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. For that one.

731
01:05:00,978 --> 01:05:06,198
I see a lot. Okay.

732
01:05:07,058 --> 01:05:11,598
Let's see what kind of shape our contracts documents

733
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,578
in, because this is the basis for everything else we're gonna do.

734
01:05:32,332 --> 01:05:37,012
And, Boy, building on this before we get the first review is

735
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:41,812
kind of risky. Because I think we're gonna find some API problems

736
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:45,292
in our first review of it.

737
01:05:50,256 --> 01:05:50,856
Uhm,

738
01:06:00,126 --> 01:06:04,986
but, I think that's

739
01:06:04,987 --> 01:06:07,406
the right thing to do. Okay, so, do I wanna use,

740
01:06:07,626 --> 01:06:09,726
what do I wanna use? Do I wanna use, like,

741
01:06:09,886 --> 01:06:12,960
plain, Oh, cliff. For the CLI,

742
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:15,300
do I wanna build it on the Limsi CLI?

743
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:20,100
If I use the Limsi CLI, the advantage is that I have lots of

744
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:24,620
design docs and review guidelines and other stuff that can help me

745
01:06:24,621 --> 01:06:27,220
do it right. Umm,

746
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,740
then you, on the other hand, you have to deal with the whole Limsi

747
01:06:30,741 --> 01:06:33,660
ecosystem bit. Umm.

748
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:40,064
That might be pretty safe way to go,

749
01:06:40,065 --> 01:06:44,944
except for the PMPM repository.

750
01:06:46,724 --> 01:06:49,284
Let's just go plain Oak left to start.

751
01:06:51,904 --> 01:06:56,524
Okay, so I'm going to do another little

752
01:06:56,525 --> 01:07:02,408
recording here. Umm,

753
01:07:08,508 --> 01:07:10,108
mz speed. Mm.

754
01:07:28,432 --> 01:07:32,972
Text. And here,

755
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:37,832
we're going to, um, use meter.

756
01:07:38,632 --> 01:07:42,852
Okay. Okay,

757
01:07:43,012 --> 01:07:46,652
this is, these are notes for a design dock that we want.

758
01:07:46,816 --> 01:07:49,236
For T-3, or tic-tac-toe,

759
01:07:49,496 --> 01:07:54,696
um, CLI. And uh, CLI is going to provide a,

760
01:07:55,176 --> 01:07:57,336
um, command-line client,

761
01:07:57,596 --> 01:08:00,316
really simple one, for, um,

762
01:08:01,056 --> 01:08:04,036
playing tic-tac-toe, um, but it's not gonna have any,

763
01:08:04,156 --> 01:08:07,136
like, visual output. Uh,

764
01:08:07,176 --> 01:08:10,856
I mean, it will, but it's just going to be,

765
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,280
pronting you, um, for your move,

766
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,780
and telling you what move it's gonna take.

767
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:21,060
Um, and we're gonna refer to the tic-tac-toe grid with lettered

768
01:08:21,061 --> 01:08:24,120
columns, numbered rows, and,

769
01:08:24,121 --> 01:08:28,760
um, we're going to use the existing model classes that are in

770
01:08:28,761 --> 01:08:30,780
the lib directory. Um,

771
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,080
this CLI will be under,

772
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,664
um, Okay, okay. Umm, the package's CLI.

773
01:08:38,904 --> 01:08:41,124
Um, it's gonna use Oakliff. Um,

774
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:44,164
we're gonna test it with the Oakliff testing tools.

775
01:08:44,984 --> 01:08:47,904
And, um, I will,

776
01:08:48,384 --> 01:08:50,924
um, append the,

777
01:08:51,164 --> 01:08:54,184
um, the read me,

778
01:08:54,524 --> 01:08:56,944
actually, I'll probably append the whole source code for the,

779
01:08:56,945 --> 01:09:00,008
um, Oakliff testing tools to make sure that we use those properly.

780
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:03,868
Um, what else? Do we need to know about the CLI?

781
01:09:04,308 --> 01:09:07,988
So, um, the command is gonna be,

782
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:10,768
Let's just make the command T3.

783
01:09:12,408 --> 01:09:19,008
Um, and,

784
01:09:19,009 --> 01:09:21,528
Let's,

785
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:26,292
You Let's make a command called,

786
01:09:26,293 --> 01:09:28,952
So the topic will be called T3,

787
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:31,452
and the command will be called new.

788
01:09:32,032 --> 01:09:36,112
And it's gonna command, Create a new game. And,

789
01:09:36,113 --> 01:09:39,372
And then, um, the,

790
01:09:39,373 --> 01:09:42,992
Um, It'll prompt for,

791
01:09:42,993 --> 01:09:46,852
First it'll take a kind of a random coin flip to see who plays

792
01:09:46,853 --> 01:09:49,536
first. S S First, the AI, or the human.

793
01:09:50,596 --> 01:09:53,556
And, um, the,

794
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:56,616
um,

795
01:09:56,617 --> 01:09:59,196
When it's the human string to play, um,

796
01:09:59,736 --> 01:10:03,316
it'll just prompt using enquirer or something like that,

797
01:10:03,516 --> 01:10:06,836
uh, to prompt you for your move,

798
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:10,616
which you'll give, like, A1 or B2 or something like that.

799
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,860
And then, um, the,

800
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,100
the AI will turn. We'll take its turn.

801
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,760
And then what will be displayed is a list of,

802
01:10:20,761 --> 01:10:23,820
um, each of the turns. Um,

803
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:28,100
you know, Player 1, and then what they turned,

804
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,640
Player 2, what they moved,

805
01:10:30,641 --> 01:10:35,240
and so on. Um, and then it'll announce the winner at the,

806
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:39,844
end of the game. Um, and that's all

807
01:10:39,845 --> 01:10:42,604
we'll do to start with. Um, let's,

808
01:10:42,624 --> 01:10:46,044
let's, that'll be Milestone 1. Milestone 2,

809
01:10:46,504 --> 01:10:49,864
um, will introduce the concept of a match.

810
01:10:50,544 --> 01:10:54,224
So there we need to add the concept of match to the lib directory.

811
01:10:54,944 --> 01:10:57,264
And a match is, um,

812
01:10:57,824 --> 01:11:00,328
the number of games. And,

813
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:03,948
um, so you can have a 5-game match,

814
01:11:04,148 --> 01:11:08,168
for example. Or, you know, play 2 out of 3 for a 3-game match,

815
01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:10,828
or 3 out of 5 for a 5-game match,

816
01:11:10,829 --> 01:11:15,408
or so on. You, you specify the number of games in the

817
01:11:15,409 --> 01:11:17,788
match. And then,

818
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:22,928
um, it'll go ahead and play a match

819
01:11:22,929 --> 01:11:25,342
with. And, you know,

820
01:11:25,402 --> 01:11:28,162
each turn, each turn, there'll be a,

821
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:30,302
um, a coin flip, um,

822
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:34,202
for who gets to start the first game. The second match,

823
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:39,362
um, or the second game in the match will be started by whoever didn't

824
01:11:39,363 --> 01:11:43,362
get to play first, the first time. And it'll just alternate from there.

825
01:11:44,202 --> 01:11:48,976
Umm. So,

826
01:11:49,176 --> 01:11:53,956
yeah, the checklist in the design document should be organized into those two milestones,

827
01:11:53,957 --> 01:11:56,416
umm, for the command line.

828
01:11:56,876 --> 01:11:57,896
Alright, that's it.

829
01:12:02,296 --> 01:12:05,916
Okay, so where is our,

830
01:12:06,336 --> 01:12:08,576
where's our notes? There's our transcript.

831
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,360
And so we need to write a new design dark.

832
01:12:14,361 --> 01:12:14,540
Mark.

833
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:12,518
And then, let's go get the Oak Lift test.

834
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:21,078
Oak Lift! Uh-uh,

835
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:23,678
uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. We don't want- we want Oak Lift.

836
01:13:23,712 --> 01:13:26,032
If we want get-up, it's not what we want.

837
01:13:26,472 --> 01:13:28,112
Get-up. Oak Lift.

838
01:13:34,332 --> 01:13:36,492
Core. No. Test.

839
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:41,712
And we're just gonna come in here to the source directory,

840
01:13:42,592 --> 01:13:45,852
and there's index, and there's a raw.

841
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:20,660
Okay. So we got a new design document coming.

842
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:26,160
How is our agent doing? Is

843
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:30,920
he stuck? Just working on

844
01:14:30,921 --> 01:14:33,300
the tests for the player.

845
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,880
Let's see if we've got any commits in that poll request yet.

846
01:14:38,924 --> 01:14:41,004
He hasn't pushed anything.

847
01:14:41,904 --> 01:14:45,644
I'm surprised. Why don't we have any pushes?

848
01:14:54,594 --> 01:14:55,254
Can I ask him?

849
01:15:13,588 --> 01:15:18,448
Sometimes what happens is that we don't actually-

850
01:15:18,449 --> 01:15:21,308
yeah, it actually could be on a branch.

851
01:15:22,148 --> 01:15:25,482
Let's look. Nope. Mm hmm.

852
01:15:49,006 --> 01:15:52,306
That's highly unusual that it wouldn't,

853
01:15:52,666 --> 01:15:54,746
usually it's pretty good about,

854
01:15:54,747 --> 01:15:58,966
um, committing at each of those subsection boundaries.

855
01:15:59,546 --> 01:16:04,086
So I'm kind of surprised, but especially if we've already got 120 turns already.

856
01:16:04,986 --> 01:16:05,746
Um.

857
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,680
Alright, how are we doing here? Alright, it doesn't really matter.

858
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,660
Just thinking about it. That's pretty Now, gonna a, so is

859
01:16:54,354 --> 01:16:56,954
Yeah, this is good. It's good.

860
01:16:56,794 --> 01:16:56,954
Good.

861
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:07,198
We're gonna get some push this pretty soon here,

862
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,678
and then we can start reviewing it.

863
01:17:15,558 --> 01:17:18,938
Yeah, it's funny. I have not seen it struggle with the edit tool,

864
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:21,358
like we are struggling today. So when you,

865
01:17:22,398 --> 01:17:26,272
um, put auto here, instead of picking a particular model,

866
01:17:26,352 --> 01:17:30,212
it's gonna use what ever model is,

867
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:32,772
kind of has the lowest load on it,

868
01:17:32,792 --> 01:17:36,592
you know? Umm, and,

869
01:17:36,593 --> 01:17:39,352
it's gonna do it free. That's a nice reason to choose that,

870
01:17:39,353 --> 01:17:41,792
and it's gonna be fast. Umm,

871
01:17:43,012 --> 01:17:45,512
but you don't always get the best model when you're doing that.

872
01:17:45,712 --> 01:17:48,392
So sometimes it's necessary to start off.

873
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:50,936
Over with a better model. Happily,

874
01:17:50,937 --> 01:17:53,196
if we stop it and restart it,

875
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:55,196
we'll get, you know, all the same context.

876
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,496
Oh, good. Here we go.

877
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,880
There's our command structure.

878
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,900
Okay, control our clients.

879
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:39,084
Okay, it didn't, it didn't really- Listen to the instructions that

880
01:18:39,085 --> 01:18:39,644
we gave it.

881
01:18:44,704 --> 01:18:45,724
It's, um.

882
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:53,984
And sometimes, you know, if it gets going, it just can't help itself,

883
01:18:53,985 --> 01:18:56,644
you know what I mean? I just, like, hehehehe.

884
01:18:59,024 --> 01:19:01,688
The output is produced so- So far, shapes,

885
01:19:02,308 --> 01:19:06,288
and it knows, I mean, a lot lots of tic-tac-toe games and so,

886
01:19:06,428 --> 01:19:08,868
and just, barrels on.

887
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:17,368
So there's probably lots of duplication with our library classes

888
01:19:17,369 --> 01:19:22,208
here. This is a formatter.

889
01:19:23,788 --> 01:19:26,272
Okay. So here's what I'm gonna do.

890
01:19:27,232 --> 01:19:32,252
Move anything with

891
01:19:32,253 --> 01:19:37,312
a display other than the list

892
01:19:37,313 --> 01:19:41,972
of turns to milestone

893
01:19:41,973 --> 01:19:44,372
three. Focus.

894
01:19:46,192 --> 01:19:47,592
First two milestones.

895
01:19:51,756 --> 01:19:55,196
On the, uhm,

896
01:19:56,016 --> 01:19:59,696
you know, invisible board play.

897
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:04,716
See, has it written checklists yet?

898
01:20:06,396 --> 01:20:10,856
Yeah. And do the checklists have good test files and,

899
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:16,790
Okay.

900
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:28,460
Basics CLI. Match system.

901
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:36,840
Invisible board play. Okay. And I'll take

902
01:20:55,284 --> 01:21:00,624
How are we doing? Agent. Okay.

903
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:02,708
Okay. Test from game engine, did it push anything?

904
01:21:03,728 --> 01:21:06,048
Yes, test. We're up to 152 passing tests.

905
01:21:06,848 --> 01:21:10,628
Let's see if get up the grease. First of all,

906
01:21:10,848 --> 01:21:13,548
do we have any branches? Yes,

907
01:21:13,588 --> 01:21:18,408
we do. There it is. And

908
01:21:18,409 --> 01:21:21,028
do we have any pull requests? No. So let's open a PR.

909
01:21:49,166 --> 01:21:52,626
Great. So, that'll give us some feedback on the test,

910
01:21:53,326 --> 01:21:57,066
and we will also get Jim and I starting a good review.

911
01:21:58,706 --> 01:22:01,286
So, how do I feel about how we're doing?

912
01:22:02,026 --> 01:22:06,506
Whoa, man, the time is flying. Um,

913
01:22:07,426 --> 01:22:12,066
so I'm not feeling great about that. I

914
01:22:12,067 --> 01:22:17,080
thought we were- gonna get to our first umm,

915
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,580
game much faster. And we're producing,

916
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:22,040
like, way more code than we needed to, right?

917
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:26,120
Like, if I hadn't taken this big design document approach to it,

918
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:29,400
but instead I had taken the approach of,

919
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,660
you know, more targeted directions,

920
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:37,544
shorter directions and so on, we would've gotten a shorter- We were files,

921
01:22:38,164 --> 01:22:40,684
we would've gotten a result faster. That would've,

922
01:22:40,984 --> 01:22:43,364
you know, de-risked the project a little more.

923
01:22:44,204 --> 01:22:47,004
So, umm, nah,

924
01:22:47,124 --> 01:22:50,544
not feeling great about, about, umm,

925
01:22:51,044 --> 01:22:53,984
about that. But, uhh,

926
01:22:53,985 --> 01:22:58,724
uhh, the hope

927
01:22:58,725 --> 01:23:02,328
is that if we've got a solid mod- a little make doing the other

928
01:23:02,329 --> 01:23:05,028
stuff a little easier. Okay,

929
01:23:05,029 --> 01:23:08,668
so what? So,

930
01:23:08,788 --> 01:23:10,888
yeah, what's up, Bill's that way. What are these,

931
01:23:11,268 --> 01:23:14,548
Jacks? What are these feeling,

932
01:23:14,808 --> 01:23:19,668
Jacks? These

933
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:23,488
code coverage tests.

934
01:23:24,028 --> 01:23:24,988
What happened with our tests? Yes.

935
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:52,366
Hm.

936
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,720
How do we get code coverage, but I'm not.

937
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,600
This. Interesting.

938
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,540
Okay. We're still working on this.

939
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,500
Oh no, this is, this is happening on the background agent,

940
01:24:29,501 --> 01:24:32,440
so I don't think I've got anything going on here,

941
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,840
so let's close that. I think we're good here.

942
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:39,374
Let's close that. Let's close that.

943
01:24:42,114 --> 01:24:45,994
And so I think I'm okay to switch branches right now.

944
01:24:47,754 --> 01:24:50,894
I guess I can open up the terminal.

945
01:24:51,574 --> 01:24:52,494
Actually, I'll just do that here. here.

946
01:25:07,308 --> 01:25:09,428
Okay, the last thing we were working on is ours.

947
01:25:10,168 --> 01:25:11,988
Yeah, our CLI guy here.

948
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:23,528
Yes, and we got our visual display,

949
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:25,812
milestone three, that's very. very good.

950
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:36,732
But, I'm not sure if the checklist section in

951
01:25:36,733 --> 01:25:38,832
four is matching the milestones.

952
01:25:41,772 --> 01:25:46,472
Let's make a background agent deal with that problem so we can

953
01:25:46,473 --> 01:25:49,292
go ahead and switch workspaces. Ours.

954
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,316
Switch branches and start checking on the other one.

955
01:25:53,296 --> 01:25:56,496
Umm. So,

956
01:25:57,476 --> 01:26:02,656
what do we want you to do? We want you to make

957
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:07,596
sure that the

958
01:26:07,597 --> 01:26:11,676
checklist,

959
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:19,300
in section 4 are aligned,

960
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:27,260
the milestones in section 5.

961
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:33,760
Combine the sections.

962
01:26:41,714 --> 01:26:44,274
Over for the animals. Umm,

963
01:26:44,454 --> 01:26:45,094
section 5.

964
01:27:47,792 --> 01:27:49,992
Now, we can safely,

965
01:27:50,096 --> 01:27:54,656
,search branches. Okay.

966
01:27:58,756 --> 01:27:59,036
Orange.

967
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,000
Okay. . . . .

968
01:28:43,664 --> 01:28:46,364
Uhh, we got lots of type errors.

969
01:28:46,944 --> 01:28:50,464
That's not nice. Not cool.

970
01:28:51,524 --> 01:28:54,084
So, the agent has not been obedient.

971
01:28:54,464 --> 01:28:58,904
It's not checking its work. Usually it is much better by doing it than

972
01:28:58,905 --> 01:29:02,184
this. But we should just just .

973
01:29:02,185 --> 01:29:04,848
. It's affected when we didn't see those pushes showing up.

974
01:29:06,688 --> 01:29:09,488
But, it's surprising to me .

975
01:29:09,489 --> 01:29:12,148
. . that we got .

976
01:29:12,149 --> 01:29:14,788
. . that we got that far. Of course,

977
01:29:14,948 --> 01:29:17,048
that could have shown up in a more recent commit.

978
01:29:17,488 --> 01:29:20,368
Let's see how many commits we've got in the .

979
01:29:20,369 --> 01:29:24,408
. . PR now. Yeah.

980
01:29:23,988 --> 01:29:27,202
Yeah. It's .

981
01:29:27,203 --> 01:29:30,662
. .

982
01:29:30,663 --> 01:29:33,222
it's um . .

983
01:29:33,223 --> 01:29:35,262
.

984
01:29:35,263 --> 01:29:38,002
these ones have been relatively okay,

985
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:41,702
I think. So .

986
01:29:41,703 --> 01:29:43,782
. . let's go back . .

987
01:29:43,783 --> 01:29:48,742
. to chat here and say .

988
01:29:48,743 --> 01:29:48,742
.

989
01:30:01,516 --> 01:30:04,016
how he is working on type errors. Isn't it exciting?

990
01:30:04,017 --> 01:30:04,696
The window in the right hand. And, slide

991
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:34,370
I'll see what it's in the middle because I'm going to interrupt it here.

992
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:40,694
It's about ready to run tests. Yes. So

993
01:30:40,695 --> 01:30:42,654
this is a good time to interrupt.

994
01:30:49,094 --> 01:30:50,014
Okay.

995
01:30:54,454 --> 01:30:56,634
So, where are we?

996
01:31:00,034 --> 01:31:02,374
We don't understand what- What?

997
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:07,328
What's going on with these ta- favorite tests? And that is of- as

998
01:31:07,329 --> 01:31:12,068
of what commit? Do we have the same thing happening here?

999
01:31:15,108 --> 01:31:17,268
Oh, oh, let's look at the actions.

1000
01:31:28,402 --> 01:31:32,622
Oh, it opened a new pull request. What's that all about?

1001
01:31:33,002 --> 01:31:35,622
I'm gonna check this for the most. Oh, well, that's the thing we just

1002
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:41,602
did. It just did it on a branch. And

1003
01:31:41,603 --> 01:31:44,022
so we can actually,

1004
01:31:48,082 --> 01:31:50,282
We can just- we can just merge that sucker.

1005
01:31:50,706 --> 01:31:57,126
Okay, umm.

1006
01:32:01,026 --> 01:32:05,106
This is the umm, this is just our design talk.

1007
01:32:05,526 --> 01:32:07,746
And we just don't really want it on this branch. So,

1008
01:32:08,146 --> 01:32:11,706
we can just merge it. Um,

1009
01:32:12,006 --> 01:32:13,186
cursor just does that by default.

1010
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:35,410
Okay. Let's make sure we don't have any new branches showing

1011
01:32:35,411 --> 01:32:37,210
up. What we're already expecting.

1012
01:32:46,034 --> 01:32:51,534
Umm. Okay. So.

1013
01:32:56,474 --> 01:33:00,994
We have eight commits on here at this

1014
01:33:00,995 --> 01:33:01,274
point.

1015
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:18,168
And this one was green as far as the test go.

1016
01:33:18,169 --> 01:33:18,388
Oh.

1017
01:33:31,282 --> 01:33:33,422
I see how, I see how it is right now.

1018
01:33:33,423 --> 01:33:33,582
You

1019
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:53,016
Yeah, still got a lot broken.

1020
01:33:54,976 --> 01:34:00,196
Bomber here is if I start

1021
01:34:00,197 --> 01:34:04,956
fixing these. I'm gonna have an emerge complex.

1022
01:34:06,416 --> 01:34:11,036
I am very eager to

1023
01:34:11,037 --> 01:34:14,196
get to done on this first section.

1024
01:35:52,076 --> 01:35:54,196
Alright, I'm going to start investigating anyway.

1025
01:35:55,016 --> 01:35:59,356
I want to know what these testifiers make.

1026
01:36:01,276 --> 01:36:02,776
Oh, these are type errors.

1027
01:36:10,296 --> 01:36:15,336
This is not. But I think what's happening here is that the-

1028
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:20,420
It's stopping because the first build

1029
01:36:20,421 --> 01:36:23,000
in the matrix fails. I think that's what it's doing.

1030
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:24,880
It's forcing an early quit.

1031
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,040
Umm, okay.

1032
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:42,004
So let's go ahead and create a design dock for the,

1033
01:36:42,104 --> 01:36:46,724
umm, for the react components.

1034
01:36:46,725 --> 01:36:47,444
And we'll see you in

1035
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:49,252
Do we commit and push?

1036
01:37:55,216 --> 01:37:59,676
Oh, he's checking on it to make sure. So we should be seeing a

1037
01:37:59,677 --> 01:38:00,676
new build.

1038
01:38:11,896 --> 01:38:12,856
What is this one?

1039
01:38:26,930 --> 01:38:29,010
Oh, it's the main, it's just the main branch.

1040
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:30,890
It's the merge on the main branch, right? . . .

1041
01:38:59,084 --> 01:39:01,164
Okay, great. We're done.

1042
01:39:02,484 --> 01:39:07,908
With as much as they're- gonna do there. Let's get a poll.

1043
01:39:09,368 --> 01:39:10,468
Let's see what we have to fix.

1044
01:39:21,608 --> 01:39:22,848
There's the fine but never used. used.

1045
01:39:59,276 --> 01:40:01,696
How are we doing? We got a bunch of new typers.

1046
01:40:01,697 --> 01:40:02,176
Cheers!

1047
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:33,330
Okay. Umm,

1048
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:38,610
so, I think our CLI dock should be in pretty good shape now.

1049
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:41,224
Let's see if we get them out. Also in the structure that way we

1050
01:40:41,225 --> 01:40:41,604
want it.

1051
01:40:54,294 --> 01:40:56,634
This is not looking like what I'm expecting.

1052
01:41:03,434 --> 01:41:06,348
Oh, it's- Because I'm on the wrong branch that got merged to Maine.

1053
01:41:07,148 --> 01:41:09,628
Mm, mm,

1054
01:41:10,448 --> 01:41:12,808
mm, mm, mm, mm. So let's just go look at it.

1055
01:41:14,428 --> 01:41:16,608
And Maine. Let me see how we're doing.

1056
01:41:17,448 --> 01:41:22,308
Mm, mm. See we're on the Maine branch.

1057
01:41:26,408 --> 01:41:29,212
And we're- Where is it?

1058
01:41:30,132 --> 01:41:32,232
I'm pretty sure we merged it.

1059
01:41:33,972 --> 01:41:38,572
So, what happened? Where did

1060
01:41:38,573 --> 01:41:39,272
we merge it to? Thank you.

1061
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,296
Don't me. Not good.

1062
01:41:56,536 --> 01:41:57,776
Not what we wanted.

1063
01:42:02,756 --> 01:42:05,336
Not what we wanted. That's too bad.

1064
01:42:05,756 --> 01:42:09,576
Oh, and we're modifying the wrong document. How did that happen?

1065
01:42:11,076 --> 01:42:16,296
I must be trying to move too fast. That,

1066
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,120
Looks no good. Good.

1067
01:43:13,428 --> 01:43:19,488
Alright, we're green. So do we get a green build on

1068
01:43:19,489 --> 01:43:23,228
this branch? No,

1069
01:43:23,288 --> 01:43:24,568
cause we haven't pushed this yet.

1070
01:43:28,852 --> 01:43:31,572
Umm, hmmm.

1071
01:43:34,192 --> 01:43:36,052
Stay in this. Yes.

1072
01:44:00,976 --> 01:44:03,196
Oh, hopefully we're gonna get a green build.

1073
01:44:11,986 --> 01:44:14,806
Okay, so I'm looking at the time here, and I would say,

1074
01:44:15,226 --> 01:44:19,340
no. I'm not happy with how things are going here.

1075
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:24,600
I was hoping I would be done with this at

1076
01:44:24,601 --> 01:44:27,120
hour one, and I'm almost done with hour two,

1077
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:31,800
so. We're not gonna get nearly as far as I had hoped to with

1078
01:44:31,801 --> 01:44:34,400
this project, but there.

1079
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:36,540
Welcome to software. Okay.

1080
01:44:46,574 --> 01:44:50,694
While I'm waiting for that, let's fix this.

1081
01:44:50,695 --> 01:44:53,214
Yes.

1082
01:45:06,478 --> 01:45:08,498
I'm just gonna be a lot more specific this time.

1083
01:45:08,499 --> 01:45:08,598
.

1084
01:46:52,144 --> 01:46:54,024
So, we should have a look.

1085
01:49:31,342 --> 01:49:34,282
Ah, shoot. She didn't do that.

1086
01:49:34,283 --> 01:49:34,402
Alright.

1087
01:51:05,998 --> 01:51:10,518
Okay. All

1088
01:51:10,519 --> 01:51:13,198
right, let's go check on our build. Yay!

1089
01:51:13,398 --> 01:51:15,638
Oh, green! Whoo! Okay,

1090
01:51:15,938 --> 01:51:18,678
finally! So,

1091
01:51:18,698 --> 01:51:23,438
let's look at the PR. That took way too long.

1092
01:51:23,958 --> 01:51:26,198
We took way too big a crank there,

1093
01:51:26,298 --> 01:51:28,318
you know what I mean? Like, you want fast,

1094
01:51:28,319 --> 01:51:32,472
tight cycles, not- like, an hour and a half to get to your first

1095
01:51:32,473 --> 01:51:36,112
commit. That's dunk. Umm.

1096
01:51:41,172 --> 01:51:43,912
Alright, let's work on review comments.

1097
01:51:43,913 --> 01:51:44,472
And that's the difference.

1098
01:51:53,856 --> 01:52:00,756
Mm good.

1099
01:52:00,836 --> 01:52:03,356
Good, good, good, good,

1100
01:52:03,357 --> 01:52:05,556
good, good, good. Let me,

1101
01:52:05,596 --> 01:52:08,916
let me see what else is here. Umm,

1102
01:52:14,716 --> 01:52:17,176
and I've served a amount of code for tic-tac-toe.

1103
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,640
Absurd!

1104
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:27,000
And it's not good to have so much code for tic-tac-toe.

1105
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:33,420
Alright, let's umm.

1106
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:38,760
What do we want to do next? We want to,

1107
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:41,760
we want to fix the review.

1108
01:52:41,761 --> 01:52:45,504
You comments and get the darn thing merged.

1109
01:52:48,324 --> 01:52:49,144
So.

1110
01:52:53,644 --> 01:52:55,284
Let's see here. You

1111
01:55:20,878 --> 01:55:23,618
How are we now organized? Are C.L.A.

1112
01:55:24,138 --> 01:55:24,638
now organized?

1113
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:58,456
I mean, are we really organized the right way?

1114
01:56:52,304 --> 01:56:56,764
The thing that I'm finding very frustrating about this exercise right now is I'm

1115
01:56:56,765 --> 01:56:59,964
just writing docs and that you're not seeing me in the code,

1116
01:56:59,965 --> 01:57:03,044
and this is not what my life is ordinarily like.

1117
01:57:04,064 --> 01:57:06,224
I mean, I use these docs,

1118
01:57:06,324 --> 01:57:10,668
but I- It's been a lot more time in the code, and I'm not

1119
01:57:10,669 --> 01:57:13,528
demonstrating that in this exercise,

1120
01:57:13,568 --> 01:57:18,048
and I'm not doing that because I'm trying to get stuff done fast,

1121
01:57:18,708 --> 01:57:23,568
and I'm not actually moving that very- very

1122
01:57:23,569 --> 01:57:25,648
fast. I mean, I'm creating lots of classes and tests,

1123
01:57:25,748 --> 01:57:30,088
but I'm not showing results at the speed I would like.

1124
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:34,352
And I'm not, uhm,

1125
01:57:34,353 --> 01:57:39,092
I'm not showing coding skills

1126
01:57:39,093 --> 01:57:41,192
or kind of understanding of code,

1127
01:57:41,193 --> 01:57:43,932
and that's frustrating to me.

1128
01:57:45,172 --> 01:57:46,392
That doesn't feel good.

1129
01:57:51,452 --> 01:57:55,096
Okay, I think this checklist is ready. I'm gonna- a Or I'll run it

1130
01:57:55,097 --> 01:57:58,456
through one more test that I sometimes often do,

1131
01:57:58,936 --> 01:58:01,776
and I use generalized specially for this.

1132
01:58:04,456 --> 01:58:06,416
And, let's say,

1133
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:30,140
actually, O3 is especially good at this.

1134
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:31,140
I'm gonna ask. It's good. Okay.

1135
01:58:51,084 --> 01:58:51,864
Okay.

1136
01:58:57,644 --> 01:59:00,484
Alright, we got a design document for React,

1137
01:59:00,884 --> 01:59:01,684
for the React stuff.

1138
01:59:08,978 --> 01:59:11,178
And we probably have some review.

1139
01:59:21,198 --> 01:59:24,138
Agreeeee. Agreeeee.

1140
01:59:45,132 --> 01:59:51,232
Ooh, I don't like this. I don't

1141
01:59:51,233 --> 01:59:54,552
like incomplete before. What is incomplete here?

1142
01:59:53,952 --> 01:59:55,112
here. 8

1143
02:00:17,746 --> 02:00:22,040
Let's start fixing. SINGING. The first issues,

1144
02:00:22,041 --> 02:00:25,100
and then I want to dig deeper into this whole placeholder thing.

1145
02:00:25,101 --> 02:00:30,220
That makes me uncomfortable. Umm,

1146
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:35,320
so. I'm gonna just tell

1147
02:00:35,321 --> 02:00:38,780
it to work on sections one through five.

1148
02:01:05,104 --> 02:01:07,144
Please address the review guide in the section.

1149
02:01:07,145 --> 02:01:08,368
I'm not sure. Those ones are fine. Bye.

1150
02:02:21,330 --> 02:02:23,990
What's the name of the branch again? And we'll see you

1151
02:02:53,804 --> 02:02:55,964
Oh, oh, oh, oh. I don't want to do that here. I want to

1152
02:02:55,965 --> 02:03:00,344
do that as a background date. Okay.

1153
02:03:06,704 --> 02:03:09,008
Okay, we got- Yeah. Right there. A lot of tabs open here.

1154
02:03:09,408 --> 02:03:13,948
Let's see where we are. We

1155
02:03:13,949 --> 02:03:18,348
don't need that anymore.

1156
02:03:21,208 --> 02:03:24,228
We are done with our design dock,

1157
02:03:24,388 --> 02:03:30,328
I think. Oh yeah, we're now just evaluating the

1158
02:03:30,329 --> 02:03:30,648
order.

1159
02:03:41,812 --> 02:03:44,912
Oh, hot, good, good, good. We got the analysis. If you adopt that sequence

1160
02:03:44,913 --> 02:03:47,152
and each milestone, each item superrequisites.

1161
02:03:48,252 --> 02:03:52,912
Yeah. O1 is super good at that particular problem of

1162
02:03:52,913 --> 02:03:56,176
making sure things are done in the right order. It doesn't always- get everyone

1163
02:03:56,177 --> 02:03:58,376
right, but it typically does pretty good.

1164
02:03:59,816 --> 02:04:00,656
So, You

1165
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:39,920
I usually work on things that are way more complicated than tic-tac-toe.

1166
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:43,560
Of course so, does everybody? Umm, so that's probably why,

1167
02:04:44,754 --> 02:04:49,594
Like, this, structure is working really well for me ordinarily,

1168
02:04:49,595 --> 02:04:52,294
but working poorly for me with tic-tac-toe,

1169
02:04:52,295 --> 02:04:55,174
I'm guessing. Okay.

1170
02:04:56,814 --> 02:05:00,014
Umm. Let's see,

1171
02:05:00,114 --> 02:05:02,254
what am I looking at here? Oh,

1172
02:05:02,454 --> 02:05:07,174
I'm going to do it, looking at review feedback. So

1173
02:05:07,175 --> 02:05:10,468
we're getting review- review. Review feedback in, so I need to spend some time

1174
02:05:10,469 --> 02:05:13,628
looking at React components. Uhh,

1175
02:05:14,128 --> 02:05:17,348
alright. Game board,

1176
02:05:18,268 --> 02:05:20,668
game cell, game status, game controls,

1177
02:05:22,508 --> 02:05:25,128
move history, game analysis,

1178
02:05:25,628 --> 02:05:27,988
player info, game sex. Ooh,

1179
02:05:28,028 --> 02:05:33,752
this is a lot of components. Reduced

1180
02:05:33,753 --> 02:05:38,212
to the most.

1181
02:05:38,213 --> 02:05:38,412
Just.

1182
02:06:09,836 --> 02:06:12,736
Well, in the time remaining, there's no way,

1183
02:06:12,737 --> 02:06:17,296
even if we copy a whole another repo that we

1184
02:06:17,297 --> 02:06:22,250
have. Are we gonna get- the

1185
02:06:22,251 --> 02:06:24,550
rest APIs, you know,

1186
02:06:24,670 --> 02:06:27,450
and I don't think. Umm,

1187
02:06:28,370 --> 02:06:30,670
let's take a look.

1188
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:35,950
So my son and I started working on- we've been working

1189
02:06:35,951 --> 02:06:40,730
on little games all summer. And we

1190
02:06:40,731 --> 02:06:46,204
have one for- so here that,

1191
02:06:59,294 --> 02:06:59,694
uhh.

1192
02:07:06,894 --> 02:07:11,448
That's the best way of doing that. See ya.

1193
02:09:09,938 --> 02:09:13,638
Uhh, I'm happy here.

1194
02:09:13,639 --> 02:09:14,098
There we go.

1195
02:10:07,246 --> 02:10:08,546
What is going on? Mm.

1196
02:10:39,890 --> 02:10:42,370
Uhh, duh. You

1197
02:16:33,870 --> 02:16:37,930
Okay, now what I want you to do is- is.

1198
02:18:09,326 --> 02:18:09,926
Alright.

1199
02:18:16,466 --> 02:18:18,866
How are we doing on review feedback here?

1200
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:38,370
I think it's just done, I think. Thank you.

1201
02:18:46,414 --> 02:18:49,974
Great. So we should have some new commits,

1202
02:19:00,554 --> 02:19:05,834
and we've got a build going on now. See

1203
02:19:05,835 --> 02:19:08,474
what we're doing here. Ahhh.

1204
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:10,728
Great. All right.

1205
02:19:57,042 --> 02:20:00,476
Okay. Thank you. Then the other problem we had was that there was,

1206
02:20:00,636 --> 02:20:03,916
like, un-implemented methods or something like that.

1207
02:20:04,356 --> 02:20:07,516
So what was that all about? So let's see if we can figure that

1208
02:20:07,517 --> 02:20:10,316
out. And we gotta get that merged.

1209
02:20:10,616 --> 02:20:15,376
I mean, that thing, this was supposed to be our very first thing,

1210
02:20:15,416 --> 02:20:18,796
and it's dragging on and on. Umm.

1211
02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:31,580
It wasn't right here.

1212
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:30,220
Okay, interesting. Okay,

1213
02:22:38,390 --> 02:22:42,610
so. Let's merge it.

1214
02:22:53,554 --> 02:22:55,934
Now it starts in duplicate stuff.

1215
02:22:55,935 --> 02:22:56,034
up.

1216
02:23:20,558 --> 02:23:24,498
Okay. So those just all have to do with the AI and how good

1217
02:23:24,499 --> 02:23:27,578
the AI is, but it won't break. So I'm gonna go ahead and merge

1218
02:23:27,579 --> 02:23:27,798
it.

1219
02:23:34,398 --> 02:23:37,972
And, Umm, we,

1220
02:23:38,152 --> 02:23:40,672
so we can build our CLI on top of it.

1221
02:23:40,852 --> 02:23:45,372
I don't think we've actually started the agent to implement the

1222
02:23:45,373 --> 02:23:49,452
CLI. We were,

1223
02:23:49,472 --> 02:23:52,972
I think, reorganizing the structure of the checklist.

1224
02:24:07,816 --> 02:24:10,796
Uhh, okay, we're ready.

1225
02:24:11,196 --> 02:24:15,796
We are ready. So let's

1226
02:24:15,797 --> 02:24:17,396
have a background agent. minute.

1227
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,060
You know, the one thing I'm wondering about. out.

1228
02:24:48,084 --> 02:24:50,604
Oh, first of all, we gotta commit that. Umm,

1229
02:24:51,024 --> 02:24:56,024
and then I'm wondering if it actually got good instruction about

1230
02:24:56,025 --> 02:24:56,864
how to write the tests.

1231
02:25:05,484 --> 02:25:06,304
This is correct.

1232
02:25:47,022 --> 02:25:49,502
I'm not seeing the test classes.

1233
02:25:50,902 --> 02:25:53,202
I'm not seeing that they were done correctly.

1234
02:26:02,106 --> 02:26:02,666
And

1235
02:26:16,616 --> 02:26:18,636
they're just creating some, ehm,

1236
02:26:19,216 --> 02:26:20,696
seems kind of silly, okay. Okay.

1237
02:26:29,740 --> 02:26:35,740
I think we're ready. I think that's good. Please

1238
02:26:35,741 --> 02:26:38,860
implement. Umm.

1239
02:26:38,861 --> 02:26:39,060
Mm.

1240
02:29:30,418 --> 02:29:32,898
Alright. So,

1241
02:29:33,238 --> 02:29:37,212
we've hit 30 minutes. So So We should be polishing now,

1242
02:29:37,213 --> 02:29:39,472
but we still haven't seen a playable game.

1243
02:29:39,992 --> 02:29:43,912
So, from a kind of risk management standpoint,

1244
02:29:44,392 --> 02:29:46,712
I'm not happy with that at all.

1245
02:29:47,452 --> 02:29:50,712
Umm. We've got lots of code,

1246
02:29:50,892 --> 02:29:53,372
it's got lots of unit tests, but we've never even seen it run yet.

1247
02:29:53,712 --> 02:29:58,172
So, shouldn't have, shouldn't have happened that way.

1248
02:29:58,992 --> 02:29:59,472
Umm.

1249
02:30:07,206 --> 02:30:10,026
We're not gonna get to react or the Fastify app.

1250
02:30:11,646 --> 02:30:15,166
Even though we've kind of got some start on that.

1251
02:30:15,946 --> 02:30:20,546
The main thing is gonna be to get through to getting

1252
02:30:20,547 --> 02:30:23,286
this command stuff done.

1253
02:31:22,288 --> 02:31:27,348
Oh, oh, oh. I just realized we

1254
02:31:27,349 --> 02:31:29,708
gave it a checklist without committing it.

1255
02:31:29,788 --> 02:31:34,408
It's working on the wrong version of it. I am

1256
02:31:34,409 --> 02:31:35,568
glad we caught that.

1257
02:32:09,456 --> 02:32:10,496
Oh, yeah, we're in.

1258
02:32:16,076 --> 02:32:16,396
Okay.

1259
02:32:55,124 --> 02:32:55,824
Hmmm.

1260
02:34:08,336 --> 02:34:08,916
Alright,

1261
02:34:20,076 --> 02:34:24,616
first let me verify that this is actually the-

1262
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:25,040
Thanks.

1263
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:38,080
Yeah. For sure. here.

1264
02:34:49,684 --> 02:34:52,744
Silly. Okay.

1265
02:34:53,684 --> 02:34:58,344
Let's tuck that up. Okay.

1266
02:35:00,044 --> 02:35:02,044
Let's make sure I'm on the right branch.

1267
02:35:26,258 --> 02:35:27,738
Interesting.

1268
02:35:48,172 --> 02:35:50,412
I just pushed that tool.

1269
02:35:53,912 --> 02:35:58,552
Alright. Put that on the wrong branch.

1270
02:35:58,553 --> 02:35:58,652
Thank you very

1271
02:36:20,016 --> 02:36:22,616
Let's make sure this is the change I thought it was.

1272
02:36:22,617 --> 02:36:24,936
And that's it.

1273
02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:39,720
Yeah. Okay. So we need a cherry pick.

1274
02:36:39,721 --> 02:36:39,940
Okay.

1275
02:36:51,344 --> 02:36:55,364
Actually, I need to just murder it this way.

1276
02:37:38,642 --> 02:37:39,242
Okay.

1277
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:39,140
One further complete test in code. For the phase.

1278
02:44:18,866 --> 02:44:21,786
Okay, well I can't really mess with this, I'm not a time.

1279
02:44:23,906 --> 02:44:25,566
Let's see how we're doing. and

1280
02:44:30,770 --> 02:44:31,850
on our command lane.

1281
02:44:46,700 --> 02:44:48,340
We got 15 minutes. Yes.

1282
02:44:56,204 --> 02:45:00,984
Uhh, okay. So.

1283
02:45:04,184 --> 02:45:08,864
I think. Let's see what branch am

1284
02:45:08,865 --> 02:45:09,204
I in.

1285
02:46:16,656 --> 02:46:18,716
Actually, this is not the right way to go. .

1286
02:47:46,162 --> 02:47:48,162
What is the name of the repository? All right.

1287
02:48:31,180 --> 02:48:32,580
So, what's he doing?

1288
02:52:18,416 --> 02:52:21,736
Alright. Let's try.

1289
02:52:35,860 --> 02:52:36,480
Mmm, heh, heh. Mm-hmm.

1290
02:53:32,548 --> 02:53:33,088
Umm, hm, hm,

1291
02:53:39,008 --> 02:53:39,248
hm, hm. You

1292
02:56:02,292 --> 02:56:02,772
Okay. Okay.

1293
02:57:25,648 --> 02:57:27,888
Okay, we're kind of on the final stretch.

1294
02:57:27,889 --> 02:57:30,488
We- we demonstrated that we had playable AI,

1295
02:57:30,888 --> 02:57:33,488
so. Like, uh, tic-tac-toe.

1296
02:57:33,908 --> 02:57:37,168
We, like, met the objective. Umm,

1297
02:57:37,848 --> 02:57:40,188
but we did it and, kind of.

1298
02:57:40,352 --> 02:57:43,432
At the last minute. And umm,

1299
02:57:43,752 --> 02:57:45,952
I'm very uncomfortable with that.

1300
02:57:46,832 --> 02:57:50,112
Umm, so let's do a little retrospective.

1301
02:57:50,712 --> 02:57:55,872
What went wrong? Well, I think fundamentally what went wrong is that I'm using,

1302
02:57:55,873 --> 02:58:00,212
you know, these big design documents that I use for,

1303
02:58:00,232 --> 02:58:04,696
kind of, really complex projects that- are,

1304
02:58:04,697 --> 02:58:07,416
kind of, two or three-day efforts.

1305
02:58:08,096 --> 02:58:12,596
Umm, and usually what happens is that the AI can,

1306
02:58:12,936 --> 02:58:15,676
you know, generate, you know, a milestone at a time,

1307
02:58:15,677 --> 02:58:18,536
test it and so on. There's review cycles in between.

1308
02:58:19,296 --> 02:58:24,216
I get involved, you know, oftentimes in- and so- and I- I

1309
02:58:24,217 --> 02:58:26,816
review those docs a lot more, umm,

1310
02:58:27,316 --> 02:58:30,900
carefully to actually- Actually, make sure I'm kind of happy with the design.

1311
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,240
And I try to compress that,

1312
02:58:34,960 --> 02:58:37,020
you know, into this three-hour chunks.

1313
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:42,040
So, the design documents were too long for the

1314
02:58:42,041 --> 02:58:46,760
kind of quick turns we needed to make in order to do

1315
02:58:46,761 --> 02:58:51,620
six iterations or, you know, four or five iterations in

1316
02:58:51,621 --> 02:58:55,304
three hours. And, um, so if I had to do it over again,

1317
02:58:55,804 --> 02:58:58,864
the way that I would do it is by using a much shorter kind

1318
02:58:58,865 --> 02:59:00,984
of design approach, um,

1319
02:59:01,504 --> 02:59:05,264
with, with smaller inputs, and that way we would get tighter cycles.

1320
02:59:05,764 --> 02:59:07,924
And, uh, we might, um,

1321
02:59:08,624 --> 02:59:11,704
we would then get, you know, additional iterations worth of work.

1322
02:59:12,224 --> 02:59:14,324
Um, you know,

1323
02:59:14,484 --> 02:59:16,544
what went well, well, I did- kids.

1324
02:59:16,608 --> 02:59:20,588
See that the agent that was working on the CLI was never gonna finish

1325
02:59:20,589 --> 02:59:22,988
in time. Uh, I mean,

1326
02:59:23,108 --> 02:59:26,968
it's now- it's just now working on implementing that,

1327
02:59:27,488 --> 02:59:29,708
you know, Section 421.

1328
02:59:30,568 --> 02:59:33,708
It'll be a while before it gets through all of those sections to get,

1329
02:59:33,709 --> 02:59:37,948
you know, three different milestones of the command line tool.

1330
02:59:38,508 --> 02:59:40,892
Um, and I pivoted to- who,

1331
02:59:41,072 --> 02:59:45,992
you know, just using Oakliffe's generator and a quick prompt to

1332
02:59:45,993 --> 02:59:49,412
knock out something really fast so that,

1333
02:59:49,413 --> 02:59:54,132
you know, I wouldn't be caught with nothing at the end of the-

1334
02:59:54,133 --> 02:59:56,832
of the cycle. So, um,

1335
02:59:57,552 --> 03:00:00,052
thanks very much for, um,

1336
03:00:00,392 --> 03:00:03,652
giving me an opportunity to, uh, to interview with this.

1337
03:00:03,792 --> 03:00:06,536
I look forward to our conversation. And,

1338
03:00:06,537 --> 03:00:08,836
um, I'll get this kind of cleaned up and pushed,

1339
03:00:09,516 --> 03:00:12,016
but, um, I won't. Uh,

1340
03:00:12,156 --> 03:00:14,216
anything else that gets pushed, uh,

1341
03:00:14,976 --> 03:00:18,596
I'll definitely make sure it gets marked with late or something like that.

1342
03:00:18,776 --> 03:00:21,576
And so it's, like, really clear kind of where we end it.

1343
03:00:22,036 --> 03:00:22,516
Thanks again.

1344
03:00:32,270 --> 03:00:35,170
And where is our,

1345
03:00:35,171 --> 03:00:37,410
err,

1346
03:00:37,550 --> 03:00:38,350
um. You
