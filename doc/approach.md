# Tic-Tac-Toe Project Summary & Milestone Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This is a 3-hour technical assessment to build a playable tic-tac-toe game using AI tools. The goal is to demonstrate engineering process, tool usage, and problem-solving under time constraints rather than creating a perfect application.

### 1.1. Key Requirements

- Build a playable tic-tac-toe game in any language/framework
- Use at least one AI tool during development
- Record the entire development session
- Submit working code with README and screen recording

### 1.2. Success Criteria

- Functional, playable game
- Clear demonstration of AI tool usage
- Evidence of critical thinking and problem-solving
- Working codebase with proper documentation

## 2. Strategic Approach

### 2.1. Risk Management Strategy

The primary challenge is balancing demonstration of engineering skills with time constraints. Key strategies:

- **Avoid Tar Pits**: Focus on getting to a playable state quickly rather than perfect implementation
- **Time Boxing**: 30-minute checkpoints to assess progress and adjust scope
- **Incremental Delivery**: Start with simplest viable implementation, then enhance
- **Code Reuse**: Leverage existing game logic from previous projects

### 2.2. Technical Philosophy

- **Done > Perfect**: Prioritize working functionality over polish
- **Critical AI Usage**: Demonstrate thoughtful use of AI tools, not blind acceptance
- **Process Visibility**: Show reasoning, tradeoffs, and decision-making clearly
- **Infrastructure First**: Establish basic project structure and workflows early

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### 3.1. Core Game Engine

Start with a mental tic-tac-toe implementation (no visual board) that accepts moves in coordinate format (e.g., "A1", "B2"). This approach:

- Eliminates UI complexity initially
- Focuses on core game logic
- Enables rapid iteration and testing
- Provides foundation for multiple frontend implementations

### 3.2. Development Phases

1. **Library/Engine**: Core game logic and state management
2. **Basic CLI**: Simple command-line interface for gameplay
3. **Enhanced Interfaces**: React app, voice activation, or other advanced features
4. **Polish & Documentation**: README, deployment, final touches

## 4. Milestone Plan

### 4.1. Milestone 1: Foundation (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Establish project infrastructure and core game engine

**Deliverables**:

- GitHub repository with basic structure
- Core game engine with state management
- Basic test framework
- Initial commit and workflow setup

**Success Criteria**:

- Game engine can handle moves and detect win conditions
- Basic project structure is in place
- Ready for rapid iteration

### 4.2. Milestone 2: Playable Game (60 minutes)

**Goal**: Create a functional, playable tic-tac-toe game

**Deliverables**:

- Command-line interface for gameplay
- Mental tic-tac-toe implementation (coordinate-based moves)
- Random AI opponent
- Basic game flow (start, play, end, restart)

**Success Criteria**:

- Can play a complete game from start to finish
- Handles invalid moves gracefully
- Demonstrates core game logic working

### 4.3. Milestone 3: Enhanced Interface (60 minutes)

**Goal**: Add a more sophisticated user interface

**Options** (choose based on time remaining):

- **React Web App**: Visual board with click interactions
- **Advanced CLI**: Better formatting, game history, statistics
- **Voice Interface**: Browser-based voice recognition for moves
- **Touch Interface**: Raspberry Pi with touchscreen (if hardware available)

**Success Criteria**:

- Improved user experience over basic CLI
- Demonstrates ability to add features incrementally
- Shows technical versatility

### 4.4. Milestone 4: Polish & Documentation (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Finalize submission materials

**Deliverables**:

- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Code documentation and comments
- Deployment configuration (if applicable)
- Final testing and bug fixes

**Success Criteria**:

- Repository is ready for submission
- Clear instructions for running the application
- Professional presentation of work

## 5. Risk Mitigation

### 5.1. Time Management

- **30-minute checkpoints**: Regular progress assessment
- **Scope flexibility**: Ready to simplify if behind schedule
- **Parallel development**: Use AI tools to generate multiple design options simultaneously

### 5.2. Technical Risks

- **UI complexity**: Start with mental game to avoid layout issues
- **AI tool limitations**: Critical evaluation of all AI-generated code
- **Integration challenges**: Modular design to isolate potential issues

### 5.3. Quality Assurance

- **Incremental testing**: Test each component as it's built
- **User feedback**: Regular gameplay testing to ensure usability
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear notes of decisions and tradeoffs

## 6. AI Tool Strategy

### 6.1. Planned Usage

- **Code generation**: Scaffold project structure and basic implementations
- **Design exploration**: Generate multiple interface options in parallel
- **Documentation**: Assist with README and code comments
- **Problem solving**: Help debug issues and optimize solutions

### 6.2. Critical Evaluation

- **Code review**: Manually inspect all AI-generated code
- **Testing**: Verify functionality before integration
- **Customization**: Adapt AI suggestions to project-specific needs
- **Learning**: Use AI to explore unfamiliar technologies quickly

## 7. Success Metrics
